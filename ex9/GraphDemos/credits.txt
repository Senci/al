For the kMeans clustering algorithm used in spectral clustering we use
the kMeans2 function from the

Piotr's Image & Video Toolbox for Matlab

developed by Piotr Dollar. It can be downloaded at 

http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/

His toolbox is released under the lesser GPL. Thanks to him for making
his toolbox publicly available.
